=======================================

.. module:: xbee

Introduction
------------

The purpose of XBee is to allow one easy access to
the advanced features of an Xbee device from a 
Python application. It provides a semi-complete
implementation of the XBee binary API protocol
and allows a developer to send and receive the
information they desire without dealing with the
raw communication details.
